Escape Button — The "Quick! Someone’s Coming!" Extension 🚨💨

Uh-oh! Someone’s sneaking up on you while you’re browsing the web, and you need to vanish like a ninja? Fear not! Escape Button has your back. This Chrome extension is your ultimate “oops, don’t look at my tabs!” tool.

Escape Button is basically your internet invisibility cloak. Perfect for when your mom, your boss, or that nosy coworker suddenly appears and you definitely weren’t watching memes instead of work.

How it works (aka your superhero moves):

Smash that secret keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Z) like a pro.

Watch your browsing history disappear faster than your dignity after an embarrassing TikTok video.

Witness all your open tabs vanish into thin air—poof! Like magic.

Be amazed when your “safe site” opens up, looking innocent AF—bonus points if it’s a cat video.

Extra perks:

Whitelist your favorite sites so they don’t get zapped (we see you, Wikipedia).

Choose your “safe site” to make it look like you were doing something productive… maybe even fool yourself.

Enjoy a flashy, particle-powered interface while secretly plotting your digital escape.

Escape Button — for the sneakiest, fastest, and funniest way to disappear online. ⚡🕵️‍♂️
